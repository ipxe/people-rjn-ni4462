Here are some samples that should be (but aren't) identical.

* Input channel ai0 is fed with a good-quality triangle-wave at 50 kHz and 0-5 V.
* PFI0 is fed with a square-wave that is synchronised with this. 
* Sampling is at 200 kHz.

The successive images should be identical, if there were no jitter in the trigger response.
(the change in amplitude and imperfect waveform shape is also a consequence).
