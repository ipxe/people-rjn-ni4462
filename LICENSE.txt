Most of this relies upon the National Instruments libnidaqmx. That is closed-source (though it is
free [gratis] to download). As this is useless without that header and linking against libnidaqmx,
this cannot be purely Free software, though it would be the author's intention to make it such. 

Therefore, this is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+, but with an exception for linking against the proprietary
library, libnidaqmx (or equivalent).
